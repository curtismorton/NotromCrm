Project Name: CurtisOS ‚Äî Unified Life & Work Management System

Overview:
This project is a full-stack personal operating system that centralizes everything I manage across life and work. It started as a CRM for my side hustle (Notrom web development) but is now evolving into a complete life management platform. CurtisOS will handle podcast production (Behind The Screens), influencer and talent work (my full-time role), side hustle operations, and personal admin (DIY, parenting, meals, finance, etc.).

It will be mobile-first, fast to use, support Siri/iPhone shortcuts, and provide a single dashboard where everything lives.

üß© Key Modules

The system will be structured into the following core modules:
	1.	Tasks: Taggable, prioritised, and linked to context (e.g. podcast, home, talent). Quick-add support via Siri/Shortcuts.
	2.	Projects: Tracks goals, milestones, and linked tasks. Used for client builds, internal launches, and home projects.
	3.	Leads: Used to manage brand/inbound/partnership outreach and progress for both my job and side hustle.
	4.	Clients: For Notrom web dev business ‚Äî tracks onboarding, contact info, and client notes.
	5.	Podcast Episodes: Behind The Screens episode tracker for planning, segmenting, publishing, and tagging.
	6.	Life Trackers: Covers meals, habits, DIY jobs, expenses, grocery lists, and anything else personal.
	7.	Quick Capture: Webhook-ready for instant logging of tasks, ideas, or expenses via iPhone or Siri.
