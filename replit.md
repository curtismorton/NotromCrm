## Overview

CurtisOS is a unified life and work management system featuring a professional "Neon Noir" visual identity. The system centralizes work management across four key areas: Notrom (web development), podcast production (Behind The Screens), day job (Head of Talent Management at Socially Powerful), and general tasks. This full-stack application features a React frontend with TypeScript and custom CSS design system, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, and AI-powered features using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The system now features enhanced productivity capabilities including bulk task actions, task templates, and comprehensive analytics dashboards.
